# PYNQ for Compute Acceleration

## What is PYNQ?

PYNQ is an open-source project from Xilinx&copy; that makes it easier to use Xilinx platforms.

Using the Python language and libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of programmable logic and microprocessors to build more capable and exciting electronic systems.

PYNQ can be used with Zynq, Zynq UltraScale+, Zynq RFSoC, Alveo accelerator boards and AWS-F1 to create high performance applications with:

- Parallel hardware execution
- High frame-rate video processing
- Hardware accelerated algorithms
- Real-time signal processing
- High bandwidth IO
- Low latency control

## Run the labs

The PYNQ for the Compute Acceleration lab is entirely run within a JupyterLab environment. For details on how to get started visit the [pynq-compute-labs](https://pypi.org/project/pynq-compute-labs/) package on PyPI and follow the instructions in the project description. Note, you should **skip** *Installing the Runtime* section and start direclty with *Installing Anaconda* section as you already installed the runtime, but make sure it is sourced.
